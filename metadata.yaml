description: "Little Men, or Life at Plumfield with Jo's Boys, is a novel by American\
  \ author Louisa May Alcott, first published in 1871. The novel reprises characters\
  \ from Little Women and is considered by some the second book in an unofficial Little\
  \ Women trilogy, which is completed with Alcott's 1886 novel Jo's Boys, and How\
  \ They Turned Out: A Sequel to \"Little Men\". It tells the story of Jo Bhaer and\
  \ the children at Plumfield Estate School. It was inspired by the death of Alcott's\
  \ brother-in-law, which reveals itself in one of the last chapters, when a beloved\
  \ character from Little Women passes away. It has been adapted to a 1934 film, a\
  \ 1940 film, a 1998 film, a television series, and a Japanese animated television\
  \ series.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
